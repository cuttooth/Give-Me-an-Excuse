Hey, I gotta go water my dog.
Hold up, I think my pool is on fire.
I think I heard your mom calling, I gotta go.
I'm late for a solitaire tournament.
Sorry but my llama needs attention.
I'm planning on having a flat tire.
Sorry but my fish is drowning.
One sec: my zebra got loose and I have to chase him down.
I can't right now: my toilet came off its foundation.
I can't because I'm trapped in an oil painting.
I'd love to but I'm stuck at an Obama fashion show.
I'm busy because I've been recruited for a new science experiment.
I have to go help that group of crows otherwise there will be a rampage.
Sorry buy my refridgerator is running and I need to catch it.
