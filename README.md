####For when you are posed with an unfavorable obligation and you need a way out.

Give Me an Excuse is a Java program that utilizes the Java Mail API to allow anyone to send a message to givemeanexcuse@gmail.com and promptly receive an excuse that the user can apply to escape their impending obligation.

Simply send a text or email to givemeanexcuse@gmail.com and you will receive an excuse.
